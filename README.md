# COGS-Inventory-Management

## Description
COGS inventory management is a web based application for inventory management system developed for indendepent and small business operators. It allows users to create limitless items to track in their weekly inventories and allows for customization of how those items are tracked or counted each week. We don't make people follow a system, we give them the tools and the freedom to create their own.

This project is not currently complete or functional as we attempt to incorporate user authentication midway through our process as we had achieved an early MVP for functionality. Ultimately our decision to press with user authentication and not having a had any prior experience with it was our projects undoing it.

I am sharing this repository as a reminder to always keep in mind group dynamics, self-care and proper project management. Set limitations and boundaries for yourself in your coding journey and you'll go further than if you hadn't. When you're tired and stressed out, you are not committing your best work.
